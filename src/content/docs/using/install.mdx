There are several ways to install moonlight, depending on where you use Discord.

:::caution
moonlight (and other client mods) are against the Discord terms of service. **Client mods are a risk** - if this makes you uncomfortable, don't install them.

Despite that, we try our best to ensure your account and system is safe. There are no reported bans from using moonlight, and moonlight disables tracking and analytics to be less detectable. Discord is more focused on fighting spam and API abuse than client modders.

## moonlight installer

:::note
The moonlight installer is the preferred way to install moonlight.
:::

The moonlight [installer](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer) automates the installation process for you. To use it, [download](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer/releases/latest) and run the installer, download moonlight through it, and then patch a Discord installation.

Discord installations are autodetected on your machine. Keep the installer in the event that a Discord update breaks moonlight, so you can unpatch Discord or update moonlight.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    <LinkButton href="https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer/releases/latest/download/moonlight-installer.exe" icon="seti:windows">Download</LinkButton>

    Download and run `moonlight-installer.exe`. Close Discord fully before patching.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="macOS">
    <LinkButton href="https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer/releases/latest/download/moonlight-installer-macos.dmg" icon="apple">Download</LinkButton>

    Download and run `moonlight-installer-macos.dmg`.
    <Aside>
      Patching on macOS may cause issues with application signing, and moonlight currently does not persist between updates on macOS. This is planned to be fixed in the near future.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Linux">
    <LinkButton href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.moonlight_mod.moonlight-installer" icon="linux">Download</LinkButton>

    Install [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/), then install the moonlight installer from Flathub.

    <Aside>
      Only some methods of Discord installations are supported:

      - Local installations in `~/.local/share`
        - A script to install Discord locally (maintained by a community member) is available [here](https://gist.github.com/maddymeows/6af1a5d5a870c13b7b159c4463edee70).
        - moonlight has an auto updater for Linux in the "Native Fixes" extension.
      - Discord installed through Flatpak as a user
        - System installations are not supported.

      Discord installations from system package managers are not supported.

## moonlight-cli

A [command line installer](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer/tree/main/crates/moonlight-cli) can be used to update and patch moonlight. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), then build the CLI from source:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer.git moonlight-cli
moonlight-cli install stable # or `moonlight-cli install nightly`
moonlight-cli patch /path/to/discord/executable
```

You can specify a custom moonlight `dist` directory with `moonlight-cli patch -m /path/to/moonlight/dist`.

## Manual installations

Manual installations are suggested for those who wish to work on moonlight itself.

- [Build moonlight](/dev/setup).
- Go to your Discord install's `resources` folder.
- Rename the `app.asar` to `_app.asar`, and create an `app` folder. Discord will load the folder instead of the `.asar` now that it has been renamed.
- Create the following files in `resources/app`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "discord",
  "main": "./injector.js",
  "private": true
}
```

```js title="injector.js"
require("/path/to/moonlight/dist/injector").inject(
  require("path").join(__dirname, "../_app.asar")
);
```

Adjust the `/path/to/moonlight/dist` to point to the `dist` folder in your locally cloned moonlight install.

You should have the following structure:

<FileTree>
- resources
  - _app.asar
  - app
    - injector.js
    - package.json
</FileTree>

## Browser

moonlight can be installed as a browser extension. To use it, [manually build moonlight](/dev/setup), and then build the browser extension:

- Manifest v3 (Chrome): `pnpm run browser`
- Manifest v2 (Firefox): `pnpm run browser-mv2`

The output extension will be at `dist/browser`. Chrome users can check "Developer mode" and click "Load unpacked" in `chrome://extensions`, and Firefox users can click "Load Temporary Add-on" in `about:debugging`.

:::caution
Browser support is experimental and may be unreliable. Developing extensions or using custom repositories is not supported with the browser extension.
:::

## Nix

moonlight offers a [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=moonlight) package and a [flake](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight/blob/main/flake.nix). It is suggested to use the nixpkgs package, but the flake lets you [pick moonlight branches](/using/getting-started#moonlight-branches) and provides optional home-manager integration.

:::caution
Nix packages are not tested often. Please leave an issue on the [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/issues) or [moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight/issues) repository (depending on which one you are using) in case of a build failure.
:::

### nixpkgs

User-level installation:

```nix title="configuration.nix"
users.users.alice.packages = [
  (pkgs.discord.override { withMoonlight = true; })
];
```

System-wide installation:

```nix title="configuration.nix"
environment.systemPackages = [
  (pkgs.discord.override { withMoonlight = true; })
];
```

### flake

```nix title="flake.nix"
{
  inputs.moonlight = {
    url = "github:moonlight-mod/moonlight"; # Add `/develop` to the flake URL to use nightly.
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  }
}
```

If you use home-manager, you can import moonlight's module, and copy [your existing moonlight config](/using/getting-started#editing-moonlights-config) into your configuration:

```nix title="home.nix"
{ inputs, ... }:
{
  imports = [
    inputs.moonlight.homeModules.default
  ];

  programs.moonlight-mod = {
    enable = true;
    configs.stable = {
      extensions = {
        allActivites.enabled = true;
        alwaysFocus.enabled = true;

        betterEmbedsYT = {
          enabled = true;
          config = {
            fullDescription = false;
            expandDescription = true;
          };
        };
      };
    };
  };
}
```
